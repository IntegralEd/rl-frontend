# IntegralEd Core Platform

## Overview
IntegralEd Core is a multi-tenant platform that provides AI-powered educational support and learning management capabilities. The platform is designed to be embedded within Softr sites while maintaining consistent branding and functionality across different educational institutions.

### Architectural Analogy

To better understand the architecture of the platform, let's use a restaurant analogy:

- **Airtable (Kitchen):** Airtable serves as the kitchen where all the data and content (ingredients) are stored and prepared. It's where the raw data is transformed into useful information.

- **Make.com and Assistants (Chefs):** Make.com (formerly Integromat) and AI Assistants are like the chefs who use the ingredients from the kitchen to create dishes. They process data, handle automation, and generate responses.

- **AWS Lambda (Expediter):** The AWS Lambda functions act as the expediter in the restaurant, coordinating between the kitchen and the dining room. They manage the flow of information, ensuring that the requests from the frontend are sent to the backend and responses are delivered promptly.

- **`docs/` Directory (Dining Room):** The `docs/` directory represents the dining room where customers interact with the menu and receive service from the waitstaff. It contains the frontend code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) that provides the user interface and user experience.

This analogy helps illustrate how each component of the platform works together to deliver a seamless experience to the end-users.

## Custom GPT Integration with Softr

### Overview
This project embeds a custom GPT-powered chat interface directly in Softr applications with conversation logging via Make to Airtable, preserving user privacy through ID-based identification.

### Key Components
1. **Lambda Function**: Handles communication with OpenAI's Assistants API
2. **GitHub Pages**: Hosts static assets for the chat interface
3. **Softr Integration**: Embeds the chat interface via HTML component
4. **Make Integration**: Routes conversations to Airtable based on user permissions
5. **Airtable**: Stores conversations and user preferences for future retrieval

### Data Flow & Privacy
- **User Identification**: System uses `User_ID` and `Organization` as primary keys across all components
- **Permission Levels**: Teacher/admin conversations automatically save; student conversations only save with explicit permission
- **Privacy First**: Production environments avoid passing email addresses, especially in educational settings with minors
- **Future Integration**: Airtable `User_Table` will store user preferences (grade level, subject, etc.) that guide prompt inputs

### Setup
1. Deploy the Lambda function with proper environment variables
2. Add the chat interface HTML to a Softr HTML component
3. Pass Softr user context to maintain conversation history
4. Configure Make webhook for conversation routing to Airtable
5. Create appropriate Airtable tables for user data and conversation storage

### User Experience
- Each user gets a persistent conversation thread
- Chat history is maintained between sessions
- The interface is fully embedded in your Softr application
- Conversations are stored anonymously using `User_ID` rather than personally identifiable information
- Future enhancements will personalize responses based on user preferences stored in Airtable

## Dynamic URL Construction and Endpoint Management

### URL Construction Logic

1. **Base Architecture**:
   - The system uses a Lambda endpoint (`https://ctgzczpglrpxybze2jz7iewmjq0wfhcp.lambda-url.us-east-2.on.aws/`) as the central communication point.
   - Each chat interface constructs URLs with specific parameters based on user context.

2. **Parameter Construction**:
   - Core parameters used across all interfaces:
     - `User_ID`: Unique identifier for the user (from Airtable/Softr/anonymous).
     - `Organization`: User's organization or default value.
     - `thread_id`: Chat thread identifier (if exists).

3. **Context Sources**:
   - **Softr Embed**: Gets user data from `Softr.user.get()`.
   - **Direct URL**: Uses URL parameters if provided.
   - **Anonymous Mode**: Falls back to 'anonymous' user if no context.

### JSON Payload Structure

1. **Standard Chat Message**:
   ```json
   {
       "user_id": "string",
       "thread_id": "string|null",
       "organization": "string",
       "timestamp": "ISO-8601 string",
       "metadata": {
           "thread_status": "active|closed",
           "last_interaction": "ISO-8601 string"
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Feedback Message**:
   ```json
   {
       "type": "chat_feedback",
       "message": "string",
       "tenant": "string",
       "domain": "string",
       "source": "URL string",
       "preview": "boolean"
   }
   ```

### Data Detection Points for Make

1. **Entry Points**:
   - New chat initiation.
   - Message sending.
   - Feedback submission.
   - Thread status changes.

2. **Trigger Fields**:
   ```json
   {
     "type": ["chat_message", "chat_feedback"],
     "thread_status": ["active", "closed"],
     "organization": ["Bmore", "Softr", "default"],
     "preview": [true, false]
   }
   ```

3. **State Management**:
   - Thread IDs are stored in `localStorage` with key pattern: `chat_thread_${userId}`.
   - Session persistence handled through browser storage.
   - Server-side state managed through `thread_id` tracking.

This architecture allows for:
- Seamless switching between authenticated and anonymous users.
- Organization-specific routing.
- Preview/production environment separation.
- Centralized webhook handling.
- Flexible feedback collection.
- Thread persistence across sessions.

### Endpoint Management

- The current Lambda endpoint is `https://ctgzczpglrpxybze2jz7iewmjq0wfhcp.lambda-url.us-east-2.on.aws/`.
- All chat interfaces and feedback mechanisms are routed through this endpoint.
- The endpoint is designed to handle both authenticated and anonymous requests, with fallback mechanisms for public access.

### Temporary Public Access Keys

- Consider using a public data store or rotated unlisted invisible table to house "temp public access keys".
- These keys can be offered to users who want to save threads but not identify by email.
- This approach ensures secure and temporary access without compromising user privacy.

   - **GitHub Pages**: Automatically builds and serves the site from the specified branch.
   - **Custom Domain**: Configured via the CNAME file and GitHub Pages settings.

### Deployment Process

1. **Local Development**
   - Run Jekyll locally to test changes before deployment.
   - Use `bundle exec jekyll serve` to start the local server.

2. **Commit and Push**
   - Make changes to the content or configuration.
   - Commit changes and push to the main branch to trigger a rebuild.

3. **Accessing the Site**
   - The site is accessible at `https://recursivelearning.app/clients/<client-name>/chat.html`.

### Benefits

- **Modularity**: Easily manage and update shared components.
- **Scalability**: Quickly onboard new clients with minimal setup.
- **Customization**: Client-specific configurations allow for tailored experiences.

This setup streamlines the deployment process and ensures consistency across all client sites.

## Static HTML Publishing

### Overview
We maintain a simple, direct approach to publishing static HTML files:
- Files are served directly from `docs/` by GitHub Pages
- No build process required for static updates
- Manual quality control over deployed content

### Directory Structure
```
docs/
├── clients/                    # All client static HTML files
│   ├── elpl/                  # Each client gets their own directory
│   │   ├── merit-chat.html # Main chat interface
│   │   └── assets/           # Client-specific assets
│   ├── bhb/
│   └── strive-together/
└── assets/                    # Shared assets
```

### URL Pattern
- `https://recursivelearning.app/clients/{client-name}/{page-name}.html`
- Example: `https://recursivelearning.app/clients/elpl/merit-chat.html`

### Development Workflow
1. **Static Updates**
   - Edit files directly in `docs/clients/{client-name}/`
   - Commit and push changes
   - GitHub Pages serves immediately

2. **New Features/Components**
   - Develop in `_clients/partials/` or `_clients/templates/`
   - Build locally to test
   - Manually copy approved changes to `docs/`
   - Commit static files directly

3. **Quality Control**
   - Review changes before committing to `docs/`
   - Test URLs and asset loading
   - Verify client-specific configurations

### Benefits
- Direct control over deployed content
- No build delays for static updates
- Clear separation between development and deployment
- Simple rollback if needed

# Recursive Learning Frontend

Multi-tenant chat interface for education and support, built with Jekyll.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Ruby 3.1.0
- Bundler 2.4.22

### Local Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
bundle install

# Start local server
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Visit `http://localhost:4000/bhb/chat` for local testing.

### Environment Configuration
- Development API endpoint is configured in `_config.yml`
- Production endpoint: `https://tixnmh1pe8.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/prod/IntegralEd-Main`

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages Setup
The site deploys automatically to GitHub Pages when pushing to `main` branch.

Key configuration:
1. Custom domain: recursivelearning.app
2. Build requirements:
   - Ruby 3.1.0
   - Bundler 2.4.22
   - Jekyll 4.2.x

### Client-Specific Assets
Client assets are organized in `_clients/<client_name>/`:
```
_clients/
  bhb/
    assets/
      images/
      css/
      js/
```

### Production URLs
- BHB Chat: https://recursivelearning.app/bhb/chat
- Other clients follow same pattern: `/client-name/chat`

## API Integration
Chat components send:
- Org_ID
- Source
- Thread_ID (if known)
- Assistant_ID
- User_ID (if known)
- Action_ID

After 5 chat volleys, prompts for account creation.

## Project Structure

### Layout System
```
_layouts/
  ├── default.html      # Base layout with main structure
  └── chat.html        # Chat-specific layout

_includes/
  ├── header.html      # Top-level header with branding
  ├── sidebar.html     # Vertical navigation
  ├── chat.html        # Chat interface
  ├── chatbar.html     # Chat input area
  ├── welcome_affirmations.html  # Welcome form
  └── playbar.html     # Navigation controls

assets/
  ├── css/
  │   ├── main.css     # Core layout styles
  │   ├── chat.css     # Chat-specific styles
  │   └── form.css     # Form styles
  └── js/
      ├── navigation.js    # Tab navigation
      ├── chat.js         # Chat functionality
      └── auth.js         # Authorization logic
```

## Implementation Notes

### 1. Layout Structure
- Base layout uses flexbox/grid for responsive design
- Header partial defines top-level constraints
- Sidebar provides vertical navigation
- Center content area adapts to active section

### 2. User Flow
1. Welcome Tab
   - Affirmations checkboxes
   - Next button (enabled after all checked)
   - Account creation option

2. Chat Tab
   - Message history
   - Input bar
   - Send functionality

3. Tools Tab
   - Initially disabled
   - Unlocks after authorization

### 3. Styling Approach
- Core layout in main.css
- Component-specific styles in dedicated files
- Brand overrides per client
- Responsive design principles

### 4. Development Guidelines
- Keep partials modular and reusable
- Use Jekyll's layout inheritance
- Maintain consistent spacing and typography
- Follow accessibility best practices

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `bundle install`
3. Run locally: `bundle exec jekyll serve`
4. Visit: http://localhost:4000

## Client Customization
Each client can override:
- Brand colors
- Logos
- Typography
- Layout adjustments

## Development Workflow
1. Create/modify layouts in `_layouts/`
2. Add partials in `_includes/`
3. Style in `assets/css/`
4. Add functionality in `assets/js/`
5. Test with `bundle exec jekyll serve`

# Recursive Learning Chat Framework

A modular, event-driven chat framework built with Jekyll for embedding context-aware chatbots.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Affirmations Module** (`_includes/welcome_affirmations.html`)
- Pure event emitter for user agreements
- State management for multiple checkboxes
- Emits `affirmationStateChange` events

2. **Chat Module** (`_includes/chat.html`)
- Handles message exchange with OpenAI Assistant API
- Maintains chat history and thread state
- Emits `chatStateChange` events with triggers

3. **Footer Module** (`_includes/footer.html`)
- UI controller responding to system events
- Manages navigation and chat input states
- Handles conditional UI element display

### Event System

```javascript
// Core Events
affirmationStateChange -> { state, complete }
chatStateChange -> { trigger, messageCount, threadId, lastMessage }
navigationRequested -> { from, to }

// UI Triggers
showResourceTeaser -> At 3 messages
showAccountTeaser -> At 5 messages
```

## Setup

1. Configure Jekyll:
```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

2. Set environment variables:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key
ASSISTANT_ID=your_assistant_id
```

## Embedding

```html
<iframe 
  src="https://recursivelearning.app/chat" 
  width="100%" 
  height="600px"
  allow="clipboard-write"
>
</iframe>
```

## Customization

### CSS Variables
```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #4a5af7;
  --surface-color: #f5f5f5;
  --text-color: #333;
  --border-color: #eee;
}
```

### Event Listeners
```javascript
window.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
  if (event.data.type === 'chatStateChange') {
    // Handle chat state changes
  }
});
```
