# Development Log

## Major Milestones

### Event-Driven Architecture (March 2024)
- Implemented pure event emitters for components
- Created state management system
- Established event communication protocol
- Removed direct DOM manipulation between components

### Component Structure
```
welcome_affirmations.html
├── Pure event emitter
├── State: { tos, norms, acknowledge }
└── Events: affirmationStateChange

chat.html
├── Message handling
├── State: { messageCount, threadId, messages }
└── Events: chatStateChange

footer.html
├── UI controller
├── State: { mode, affirmationsComplete, messageCount }
└── Events: navigationRequested
```

### Key Improvements

1. **Event System**
- Components communicate only through events
- Clean state management
- Predictable UI updates
- Easy to extend and modify

2. **UI/UX**
- Responsive design
- CSS variable theming
- Smooth transitions
- Mobile-friendly layout

3. **State Management**
- Local state per component
- Event-based updates
- Thread persistence
- Message history tracking

## Testing Notes

### Event Flow
```
User checks affirmation -> affirmationStateChange
↓
Footer enables next button
↓
User clicks next -> navigationRequested
↓
Chat interface appears
↓
User sends message -> chatStateChange (messageAdded)
↓
Assistant responds -> chatStateChange (responseReceived)
```

### Trigger Points
- Resource teaser: 3 messages
- Account teaser: 5 messages
- Navigation: After all affirmations
- Chat activation: After navigation
