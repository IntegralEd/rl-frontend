4. [ ] Update all file paths to use root-relative paths
5. [ ] Test all pages locally
6. [ ] Deploy and verify all pages are accessible
7. [ ] Document new URL schema for stakeholders

## Notes
- All paths should be root-relative (starting with /)
- Keep client-specific assets in their respective directories
- Shared assets should be in the root /assets directory
- Test all pages in incognito mode to verify paths
